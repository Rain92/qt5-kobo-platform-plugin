; If you encounter weird Nickel behavior after exiting KOReader, set this to true
; On some HW/FW combos, this may translate into wonky power management.
; For instance, and somewhat more severely, on my H2O, the IR grid touchscreen will often never wakeup after a suspend.
; I've also seen broken USBMS behavior on some newer FW versions, so, that's fun, too...
